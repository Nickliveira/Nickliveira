I'm a 19 year old Software Engineering student from Brazil. Who is primarily interested in web development (specifically back-end), API development, networking, forensics, software engineering and development, and information/cyber security. I have been playing with computers for a long time and today it has turned into my job. I have run several projects over the past few years. I also know business and am open to questions, see contact options below.
